# Overview
- This repository is for keeping track of my problem-solving practice; the sources of problems vary: from various textbooks to websites.
- The sources will be specified later.
- Code for C++ will be appended subsequently; in the meantime, only the Java and Python code will be recorded.
- I guess there will be hardly anyone who's going to browse my source code; but if any, please consider that this is just for my personal practice, and the code is not confirmed as thoroughly valid.
