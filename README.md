# Overview
- This repository is for keeping track of my problem-solving practice; the sources of problems vary: from various textbooks and websites. I think I'm not going to specify the source for each case, but this can be changed afterward.
- Code for C++ and Python will be appended subsequently; in the meantime, only the Java code will be recorded.
- I guess there will be hardly anyone who's going to browse my source code; but if any, please consider that this is just for my personal practice, and the code is not confirmed as thoroughly valid.
